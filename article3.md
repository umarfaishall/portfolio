# Volunteer Management Web Development with Laravel Framework

This project is the development of a feature of a website, namely the volunteer management feature.
<br>
<br>

## Description
---
In this project I developed a website feature using the PHP programming language with the laravel framework and with the MySQL database. this website has features including: 
<br>
<br>

**1. Login and Register** 
<br>
Users can login if they already have an account and register if they don't, but users can still access the web without logging in, it's just that the features are limited 
<br>
<br>

**2. Register for Social Activities** 
<br>
Users can register themselves as volunteers in social activities available on the website 
<br>
<br>

**3. Monitoring Activities** 
<br>
Registered volunteers can check whether they have finished and see the details of what activities will be carried out in the social activities they are participating in 
<br>
<br>

**Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Laragon, TablePlus, Excel, Word
<br>
<br>
Here are the results of the development I did:
