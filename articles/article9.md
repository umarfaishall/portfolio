## Description
---
In this project, I performed automated api testing using the Newman tools and Github Action for CI/CD (Continues Integration/Continues Deployment).

In testing this API, I tested several requests, namely GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. I will check whether the responses generated match the requests given in accordance with the API documentation.
