This project discusses Automated Testing of a Mobile Aplication using Robot Framework + Appium. 
<br>
<br>

## Description
---
In this project, I performed automated mobile apps testing using the Robot Framework and Appium tools.
<br>
<br>
I conducted simple testing for mobile apps, such as whether users could login to the app, whether the app buttons worked properly, etc.
<br>
<br>
This project used Appium as an automation testing tool for mobile applications and used a robot framework to store keywords for easier use during the testing process.
<br>
<br>

**Tools:** Appium, Appium Inspector, Robot Framework, Android SDK
<br>
<br>
Here are the results of the development I did:
