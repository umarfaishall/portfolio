# Web Automation Testing

This project discusses Automated Testing of a website using Cypress. 

The website can be accessed via the following url: https://kasirdemo.vercel.app/
<br>
<br>
This website is a simple cashier system with functions that allow users to login & register to the system, add product to system, add purchase, etc.
<br>
<br>

## Description
---
In this project, I performed automated web testing using the Cypress tools.
This testing examined various features, from login, register, management product, add customer and cashier, etc.
<br>
<br>
This automated testing uses the POM (Page Object Model) to make it easier to manage testing scripts.
<br>
<br>

**1. Login and Register** 
<br>
In this section, I check positive and negative cases such as successful login, incorrect password, incorrect username, etc.
<br>
<br>

**2. Product & Category** 
<br>
In this section, I check product and category management, such as adding, update, and deleting products and categories.
<br>
<br>

**3. Purchase & Sales** 
<br>
In this section, I check positive and negative cases related to purchases and sales, such as adding, updating, and deleting purchases and sales. Then I check various possibilities of what would happen if there was incomplete data during a transaction.
<br>
<br>

**4. Customer & Cashier** 
<br>
In this section, I check positive and negative cases related to customer and cashier data, such as add, update, and delete. 
<br>
<br>

**Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Cypress
<br>
<br>
Here are the results of the development I did:
