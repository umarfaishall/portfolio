# Web Automation Testing

This project discusses Automated Testing of a website using Selenium WebDriver. 

The website can be accessed via the following url: https://www.saucedemo.com/ 
<br>
<br>
This website is a simple e-commerce system with functions that allow users to log in to the system, add items to their shopping cart, and check out their purchases. 
<br>
<br>

## Description
---
In this project, I performed automated web testing using the Selenium WebDriver tools with Cucumber and JUnit.
This testing examined various features, from login, inventory until checkout. 
<br>
<br>
This automated testing uses the TDD (Test Data Driven) format because it uses Cucumber and POM (Page Object Model) to make it easier to manage testing scripts.

**1. Login** 
<br>
In this section, I check positive and negative cases such as successful login, incorrect password, incorrect username, etc.
<br>
<br>

**2. Inventory** 
<br>
In this section, I check various possibilities such as adding items to the cart and removing items from the cart, which can be done from various pages.
<br>
<br>

**3. Checkout** 
<br>
In this section, I check various positive and negative possibilities such as successful checkout, incomplete customer checkout data, etc. 
<br>
<br>

**Tools:** Intellij, Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, JUnit, Maven

Here are the results of the development I did:
